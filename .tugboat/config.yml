  # What to call the service hosting the site.
  php:

    # Use PHP 7.1 with Apache
    image: tugboatqa/php:7.1-apache

    # Set this as the default service. This does a few things
    #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container
    #   2. Exposes port 80 to the Tugboat HTTP proxy
    #   3. Routes requests to the preview URL to this service
    default: true

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:

      # Commands that set up the basic preview infrastructure
      init:

        # Link the document root to the expected path. Tugboat uses /docroot
        # by default. So, if the application is located at any other path in your git
        # repository, change that here. This example links /web to the docroot
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/web" "${DOCROOT}"

  # What to call the service hosting MySQL. This name also acts as the
  # hostname to access the service by from the php service.

    # Use the latest available version of MySQL by not specifying a

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:

      # Commands that import files, databases, or other assets. When an
      # existing preview is refreshed, the build workflow starts here,
      # skipping the init step, because the results of that step will
      # already be present.
      update:

        # Copy a database dump from an external server. The public
        # SSH key found in the Tugboat Repository configuration must be
        # copied to the external server in order to use scp.
